# WBAPI

A one-stop hub for accessing various War Brokers APIs and DBs.

Prior to this project, developers had to manually scrape War Brokers' website
or use undocumented API endpoints. WBAPI aims to solve this problem by
providing simple interface between it and you.

## Usage

Documentations and APIs can be found in https://wbapi.wbpjs.com/api-docs

## Setting up

To test the project locally, perform the following steps:

1. Set up monorepo ([`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md))
2. Open a terminal emulator in this (`wbapi`) directory
3. Start a server in http://localhost:5000

   ```
   yarn start
   ```
